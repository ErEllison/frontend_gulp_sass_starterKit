## important Note
please note that in gulpfile.js we set our browserSync to show us the public folder that is been generated by npm start using gulp, the point if this is that i want to see changes for production level of the project , if you set your browser sync to show you the src folders content , may be at some points your link just breaks and the changes does not shows up in production level, andf that's it ....
enjoy it ...
